## Project: Predicting House Prices with Regression using TensorFlow
### About this Course
**Taught by**: *Amit Yadav*, Rhyme

In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and you will learn to use it to solve a basic regression problem. By the end of this project, you will have created, trained, and evaluated a neural network model that, after the training, will be able to predict house prices with a high degree of accuracy.
